## Summary
> **“The application of GIS is limited only by the imagination of those who use it”.** ~ _Jack Dangermond_, Esri



Hoda Tahami’s research interests cover Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning/navigation and GIS science.
Tahami focuses on advanced algorithms that are used in the PPP solution for the monitoring and forecasting of the atmosphere events.
Tahami's ongoing research topics include utilizing GNSS to monitor tropospheric perturbations to observe the hurricane events and using the web GIS techniques to visualize them for the early warning and decision support sytems.
